### tmorville.github.io
The intention of this website is a platform to share streamlined [notes and code]({{ site.url }}/projects) while playing a bit of research catch-up or just exploring interesting stuff. I am widely interested in machine learning with an emphasis on putting models in production. 

Find my CV [here](https://tmorville.github.io/markdown-cv/). 

### research
My research triangulates between theoretical neurobiology, applied mathematics and machine learning. You can find my writing [here]({{ site.url }}/writing). 

<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and themed by [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). </span>
