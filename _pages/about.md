### research
My research triangulates between neuroscience, applied mathematics and machine learning. Currently, I work as a research consultant at the Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance & and senior data scientist at 2021.ai. You can find my writing [here]({{ site.url }}/writing). 

Find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/cv/CV.pdf). 

### tmorville.github.io
The intention of this website is a platform to share streamlined [notes and code]({{ site.url }}/projects) while playing a bit of research catch-up or just exploring interesting stuff. I am widely interested in implementation of deep learning, control theory, reinforcement learning, computational neuroscience and applied mathematics.
